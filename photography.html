    <h4 id="dwos"><em>Different Ways of Seeing</em> (2016)</h4>
    <p class="statement">This body of work is a visual conversation between two photographic,
      lens-based technologies: large format chemical photography and satellite photography
      applied to 3D models of buildings generated by Google Earth. Both are examples of
      scientific instruments that are used in an attempt to objectively describe reality
       through visual means, but the technology used - and therefore the media - still
       imposes itself on these so-called "objective" depictions of reality. Desaturation
       is replaced by low-resolution imaging and peculiar 3D modeling.<br><br>
    All locations depicted were photographed on 4x5 large format film using a Toyo
    Field 45C camera, and screenshotted via the Google Earth interface. All
    locations are in Fort Collins, CO.<br></p>

          <h4 id="collodion"><em>Collodion Work</em> (2013-14)</h4>
          <p class="statement"><em>Collodion Work</em> is a series of photographs made using the 19th
          Century Wet Plate Collodion process. This process was the first "instant" imaging system,
          and was very popular during the later half of the Century up until the inventions of the Kodak Brownie camera
          and roll film in the early 20th Century. After these technologies became widespread,
          the process fell into obscurity until the 21st Century where it is currently experiencing a revival.<br>
          These images document the landscape and objects in Northern Colorado, intentionally keeping
          the actual decade of their production hidden until close observation reveals signs of the modern era.<br>
          Due to the process, each image is wholly unique and cannot be reproduced by traditional means. All artwork is in an edition of one.</p>

    <h4 id="mom"><em>Methods of Manifestation</em> (2012)</h4>
    <p class="statement"><em>Methods of Manifestation</em> is a 10-image experimental series
      using silver gelatin photography. Burn marks were made directly on the film and translucent paper
      sandwiched between glass and photographic paper during printing. The marks made allude to
      forest fires and irreversible destruction, but also the emergence of new life that comes afterwards.
      All photographs were toned with selenium and coffee after printing, and were printed in an edition of one.</p>
